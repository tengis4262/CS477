Use express.js framework to implement a web application which has the following features:

User makes a request to http://localhost:8080/, the browser displays a page with a signup form which has two inputs: firstname and lastname, and 1 submit button.
When user clicks submit button in the browser, browser makes a POST request to http://localhost:8080/signup URL. On the server side, 
the web application gets user’s the inputs(firstname and lastname), then stored in the database.txt file, should append not replace.
If firstname or lastname is empty, goes back to signup form with error message: "Firstname and lastname are required".
If stored successfully, display “saved successfully” message in the browser.
If stored failed, display “saved failed” message in the browser.

When you store user's info, The format of database.txt file looks like below:

john=smith,Bella=Lord,Edward=Hopkins


NOTE: It’s your own choice use html file, then read the html file and send back. Or you send strings directly to the browser.

You’re free to import other modules you need. You’re free to use Router class too.
